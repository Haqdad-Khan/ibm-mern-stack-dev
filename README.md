This repository will document my entire journey through the specialization, including the course outlines, certificates, and the featured projects I create throughout the program.

## Overview

The **IBM Full-Stack JavaScript Developer Professional Certificate** is an in-depth learning path that will equip me with the necessary skills and knowledge to become proficient in developing full-stack web applications using the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js). And **DevOps & Cloud Native** tools and technologies (Containerization w/ Docker, Kubernetes, OpenShift, Microservices & Agile, Scrum etc).

This repository will serve as a central hub to track my progress, showcase projects, and house all relevant materials and certificates related to the specialization.

## Completed Courses

As of now, I have successfully completed the first two courses of the specialization:

**Course 1: Introduction to Software Engineering**  

**Course 2: Introduction to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**  
   - This course provided me with a strong foundation in web development fundamentals, including HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. This course also introduced me to the new css frameworks & libraries for efficient styling and design. The final project of this course was a portfolio website showcasing my skills and achievements.

## Certificates

Upon successful completion of each course, I will receive a certificate from **IBM**, which will be shared on *LinkedIn*. You can also find my [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/haqdad-khan) and [GitHub](https://github.com/haqdad-khan) for further details on my certifications.
