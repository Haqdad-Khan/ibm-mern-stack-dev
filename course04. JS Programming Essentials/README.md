# JavaScript Programming Essentials

It contains the code and projects completed as part of the **Fourth Course** course in the [IBM Full Stack JavaScript Developer Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-full-stack-javascript-developer) specialization on Coursera.

## About the Course

This course provides an introduction to the foundational concepts of programming in JavaScript. It focuses on the core features of JavaScript that are essential for writing dynamic applications, including data types, operators, functions, loops, arrays, and more. By completing this course, learners will be equipped with the necessary skills to start building JavaScript-based applications.

### Key Topics Covered:
- **Data Types and Variables**
  - Primitive types (string, number, boolean, null, undefined)
  - Declaring variables using `var`, `let`, and `const`
  - Type conversion and type coercion

- **Operators**
  - Arithmetic operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, etc.)
  - Comparison operators (`==`, `===`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, etc.)
  - Logical operators (`&&`, `||`, `!`)
  - Assignment operators (`=`, `+=`, `-=`, etc.)

- **Functions**
  - Defining functions using function declarations and expressions
  - Parameters and return values
  - Function scope and closures
  - Arrow functions and anonymous functions

- **Control Flow**
  - Conditional statements (`if`, `else if`, `else`, `switch`)
  - Ternary operator
  - Loops (`for`, `while`, `do...while`)
  - Iteration over arrays and objects

- **Arrays and Array Methods**
  - Creating arrays and accessing array elements
  - Array methods: `push()`, `pop()`, `shift()`, `unshift()`, `concat()`, `slice()`, `splice()`, `forEach()`, `map()`, `filter()`, etc.
  - Iterating through arrays with loops and array methods

- **Iterating Arrays**
  - Iterating over arrays using loops and array methods
  - `forEach()`, `for...in`, and `for...of` loops

- **Objects**
  - Creating and accessing objects
  - Object properties and methods
  - Working with `this` keyword

- **DOM Manipulation**
  - Selecting and modifying DOM elements (`getElementById`, `querySelector`, etc.)
  - Modifying element content, styles, and attributes
  - Event handling (e.g., `addEventListener`)
  - Dynamically adding or removing elements from the DOM
  - Working with forms, buttons, and user input

- **Asynchronous JavaScript**
  - Understanding callbacks, promises, and async/await
  - Handling asynchronous operations (e.g., API requests, timers)
  - Using `setTimeout` and `setInterval`
  - Working with `fetch` API for making HTTP requests
  - Handling promise chaining and error handling in async operations

- **Error Handling**
  - Try-catch blocks
  - Throwing errors
