# Haqdad Khan - Portfolio

This is the portfolio website for Haqdad Khan, a Front-End Developer with a focus on HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and modern web design frameworks. The website was created as the final project for the **[Introduction to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript](https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-html-css-javascript)** course, which is part of the **[IBM Full Stack Developer - Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-full-stack-javascript-developer)**. The project aims to demonstrate my skills in creating a fully functional and responsive web portfolio using fundamental web technologies and modern tools like **Tailwind CSS** and **JavaScript**.

## Project Overview

In this portfolio, I showcase the following sections:

- **Hero Section:** An introduction with a brief overview of who I am, my skills, and my experience. It also includes contact details such as phone and email.
  
- **Skills Section:** A visual grid of my front-end skills with associated icons for technologies like **HTML5**, **CSS3**, **JavaScript**, **React**, **Node.js**, **Bootstrap**, and **Tailwind CSS**.

- **Projects Section:** A showcase of the various web development projects I’ve worked on. It contains summaries and descriptions of the projects that I have developed, demonstrating my hands-on experience with front-end and back-end technologies.

- **Recommendations Section:** This section features testimonials from colleagues and collaborators, highlighting my skills, work ethic, and contributions to the team. Additionally, it includes a form for users to submit their own recommendations.

- **Contact Details:** My contact information, which is accessible through the hero section, including my phone number and email address, making it easy for potential employers or collaborators to reach out.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: The structure of the entire webpage is built with semantic HTML5.
- **CSS3**: For styling the layout and providing visual enhancements.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework to design the layout and components, providing responsiveness and a clean design.
- **JavaScript**: Used to add interactivity, such as the smooth scrolling behavior and popup functionality when submitting recommendations.
- **DOM Manipulation**: JavaScript DOM was used to dynamically control and update the website’s content based on user interaction, such as the recommendation form submission.
